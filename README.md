# ECE 50024 – Practical Machine Learning

This repository contains hands-on implementations and experiments based on the ECE 50024 (Machine Learning) course at Purdue University, focusing on bridging theory with practical applications.

## Course Context

ECE 50024 is a graduate-level machine learning course covering regression, regularization, kernel methods, optimization, and probabilistic modeling.  
This repository complements the theoretical lectures by implementing core algorithms from scratch, running controlled experiments, and analyzing their behavior on synthetic and real datasets.

- A short README explaining key ideas and takeaways

## What This Repository Focuses On

- Implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch
- Understanding bias–variance tradeoffs through experiments
- Studying the effect of regularization (Ridge, LASSO)
- Exploring kernel methods and the kernel trick
- Solving ML problems using optimization techniques
- Visualizing model behavior and failure modes

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn (for comparison)
- CVXPY (optimization experiments)
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Use

Each lecture folder is self-contained.  
Open the notebooks in order to follow the progression from basic regression to advanced optimization techniques.
